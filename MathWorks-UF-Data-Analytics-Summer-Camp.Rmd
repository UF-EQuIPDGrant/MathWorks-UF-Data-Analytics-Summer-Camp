With these resources, students will build a strong foundation in MATLAB, advancing from basic coding principles to complex machine learning models. The curriculum emphasizes practical applications, guiding students through hands-on activities and culminating in a final project where they create and present their own unique models.

Whether you're teaching foundational programming skills or diving into data analytics and machine learning, this hub provides comprehensive, step-by-step materials to make your instruction both effective and engaging. Even if you're new to MATLAB or AI, the tutorials, ready-made tools, and well-structured lesson plans here will equip you to lead students confidently through real-world data challenges in sports and music contexts.

# **Program Overview**
AI, machine learning, and programming are transforming how we live and work—whether it’s through facial recognition, personalized recommendations, or predictive tools in sports and entertainment. These technologies are now essential skills for students to learn.

The MathWorks UF Data Analytics Summer Camp gives students hands-on experience with data analytics and AI using MATLAB. Students act as data analysts for a sports team or music label, using data to make real-world predictions, like identifying the next breakout athlete or music star.

This repository provides teachers with everything they need to teach these concepts effectively, including lesson plans, activities, and real-world examples to engage students and bring AI and data analytics to life.

## Program Roadmap

**1. Foundations of Data Analytics and MATLAB**

# **What You Need to Get Started**
In this section, we will walk you through the essential tools and resources required for instructors and teachers before diving into the lessons provided. These include MATLAB Online, the Spotify API, a list of whitelisted websites, and MATLAB Drive.

## MATLAB Online
MATLAB Online is the cloud-based version of MATLAB, allowing you to use MATLAB directly through your web browser without needing to install or download any software. This environment provides full access to the programming features and tools available in the desktop version. Throughout this course, MATLAB Online will be the primary platform for teaching students programming concepts, machine learning, and AI tools in a seamless, accessible way. With MATLAB Online, students can easily access lessons from any device with an internet connection, making it ideal for both in-class and remote learning. This  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwNFpoY3dKk" target="_blank">link</a> provides instructions on creating a MathWorks Account and accessing MATLAB Online.

## Spotify API
The Spotify API will play a significant role in many lessons, particularly those involving data retrieval and manipulation. The Spotify API is a RESTful web service that allows users to access Spotify’s vast music database without needing to install software locally. Students will use it to gather real-world music data for various exercises and projects, such as creating prediction models or analyzing song attributes like danceability or duration. Teachers will need to guide students in setting up API access and using it to fetch and process music-related data, which can be integrated into their MATLAB projects. This <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api" target="_blank">link</a> provides the developer page for the Spotify API.

## White List Websites
Some websites and services used throughout this course may be blocked by school networks or firewalls. To avoid any disruptions, a PDF document is provided with a list of essential websites that need to be whitelisted or unblocked before teaching can begin. This ensures smooth access to necessary online resources, such as APIs and MATLAB Online. The list includes links to key websites that students and instructors will need throughout the course, so be sure to review and address any restrictions with your IT department ahead of time. <a href="https://github.com/UF-EQuIPDGrant/MathWorks-UF-Data-Analytics-Summer-Camp/blob/c770bdf30c62b9d31261fe66f2b61ae98d48cf95/Additional%20Resources/MATLAB%20Camp%20-%20Website%20Whitelist%20(2).pdf" target="_blank">PDF link</a>

# **Lesson Resources**
This section outlines the course structure you'll follow when teaching your students. Each lesson is divided into two main components: a Programming section and an AI section. Together, these sections build the foundational skills and knowledge necessary for students to complete a final project that combines programming and AI concepts in MATLAB.

**Programming Section**

The programming portion of each lesson focuses on core MATLAB syntax and basic programming concepts. These lessons equip students with essential skills to navigate MATLAB and use it as a problem-solving tool. Topics covered include printing outputs, modifying images, accessing and working with files, and creating plots. The aim is to provide students with a strong foundation in MATLAB, ensuring they have the confidence and ability to apply these skills in their final project.

**Artificial Intelligence Section**

In the AI section, students will explore the real-world applications and ethical considerations of AI. Lessons cover a wide range of topics, including image recognition, autonomous vehicles, and more. These lessons will not only introduce students to the technical aspects of AI but also foster discussions about its implications in society. By the end of this section, students will have a solid understanding of AI’s potential and limitations, preparing them to integrate AI into their own projects.

**Final Project**

The two sections of the course culminate in an exciting final project where students will use their programming and AI knowledge to create a predictive AI tool in MATLAB. Whether they choose to predict the next big pop artist, identify the next star soccer player, or focus on another field of their choice, this project allows students to combine creativity with technical skills.

**Lesson Pacing**

Each programming and AI lesson was designed to take approximately 85 minutes to complete. This may vary depending on the pace of the students in your camp. The course is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing you to tailor the lessons to your students' needs while maintaining structure and clear learning outcomes.
