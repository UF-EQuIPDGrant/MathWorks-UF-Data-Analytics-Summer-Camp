### Accessing Lesson Folders

-   Contact the school district STEM or science department to offer an
    opportunity to host a summer program.
    -   If you know a teacher that would like to host the summer program
        and has permission from their school principal to host the
        summer program, work with them and the school team.
-   They should work with you to identify a target school to host the
    summer program if a school is not already in mind.
